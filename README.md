# Polymer Summit 2017

## Develop

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli

Second, install [Bower](https://bower.io/) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

    npm install -g bower
    
Build process

```$ polymer build```

* `es5-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is compiled to ES5 for compatibility with older browsers.
* `es6-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that can handle ES6 code - see [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production#compiling) for a list.
* `es6-unbundled` is an unbundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that support HTTP/2 push.

Run `polymer help build` for the full list of available options and optimizations. Also, see the documentation on the [polymer.json specification](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-json) and [building your Polymer application for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production).

Serve

```$ polymer serve``` or ```$ polymer serve build/[version]```

### Run tests

This command will run [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
against the browsers currently installed on your machine:

    polymer test

If running Windows you will need to set the following environment variables:

- LAUNCHPAD_BROWSERS
- LAUNCHPAD_CHROME

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections of the
application. Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the list of
`fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file. This will ensure those
components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached components
and will be included in the build.
